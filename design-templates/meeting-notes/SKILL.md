# Meeting Notes Skill

Produce a single-screen meeting notes page.

## Workflow

1. Read DESIGN.md.
2. Layout:
   - Header: meeting title, date, time, location/Zoom, attendees row.
   - Agenda checklist (4–6 items).
   - Decisions panel — bulleted list with strong styling.
   - Action items table with owner, due date, status.
   - "Open questions" + "next meeting" footer.
3. Subdued colour palette, clear hierarchy.

## Output contract

```
<artifact identifier="notes-name" type="text/html" title="Meeting Notes">
<!doctype html>...</artifact>
```
